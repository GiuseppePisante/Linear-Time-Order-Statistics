# AACAP @ polimi - Challenge 2
In order to compile and use this code, you must clone the repo, then go into the test directory and chose the test you want to execute.
Once inside the directory, create a "build" directory using

$ mkdir build

Then you must go into that directory and create the makefile:

$ cd build
$ cmake ..

Then you can compile simply by typing "make" in the build directory and execute the test by typing "./test_01"
